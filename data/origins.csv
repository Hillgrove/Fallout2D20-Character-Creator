Vault Dweller;<p>Your healthier start to life at the hands of trained doctors and sophisticated auto-docs means you reduce the difficulty of all END tests to resist the effects of disease. In addition, your carefully-planned upbringing means you have one additional tag skill of your choice.</p><p>You may also work with the Gamemaster to determine what sort of experiment took place within your Vault. Once per quest, the GM may introduce a complication which reflects the nature of the experiment you unwittingly took part in, or introduce a complication related to your early life of isolation and confinement within the Vault. If the GM does this, you immediately regain one Luck Point.</p>;0;["Reduced END Test Difficulty", "Luck Point Recovery", "Additional Tag Skill"]
Survivor;<p>You are the living legacy of the people who prepared for Armageddon on their own. You are only alive in the post-nuclear apocalyptic landscape because your forebears dug in, survived, and found community enough to continue humanity’s existence.</p><p>You could be from any number of settlements, isolated shelters, or traveling groups that sparsely populate the wasteland from West Coast to East Coast. You could be from the New California Republic, carrying on the legacy of Vault 15 and Shady Sands. You could fight to protect others, calling a group of survivors like the Minutemen or the Regulators your home. You could also be a merciless raider or be born into one of these groups but escaped in order to rehabilitate and reform.</p>;2;["Educated", "Fast Shot", "Gifted", "Heavy Handed", "Small Frame", "Extra Perk"]
Brotherhood of Steel;<p>As a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, you are bound by the chain of command: The Chain that Binds. You must carry out the orders of your immediate superiors, and you are responsible for your subordinate siblings. If you do not carry out your duty, you are expelled from the Brotherhood and your technology will be reclaimed—by any means necessary.</p><p>You gain one additional Tag skill, which must be one of Energy Weapons, Science, or Repair.</p>;1;["Tag Energy Weapons", "Tag Science", "Tag Repair"]
Ghoul;<p>You age at a much-decreased rate, and you’re probably older than your unmutated companions—you may even have survived the Great War of 2077—but you’re sterile: “the first generation of ghouls is the last” as the saying goes. You may face discrimination from “smoothskins” (humans who aren’t ghouls), increasing the difficulty or complication range of Charisma tests depending on your opponent’s beliefs.</p><p>You are immune to radiation damage. In fact, you’re healed by it—you regain 1 HP for every 3 points of radiation damage inflicted upon you, and if you rest in an irradiated location, you may re-roll your dice pool when checking if your injuries heal. In addition, Survival becomes a Tag skill, increasing it by 2 ranks.</p>;0;["Rad Healing", "Rad Resting", "Tag Survival"]
Mister Handy;<p>You have 360° vision and improved sensory systems that can detect smells, chemicals, and radiation, reducing the difficulty of Perception tests that rely on sight and smell by 1. You are also immune to radiation and poison damage, but you cannot use chems, nor can you benefit from food, drink, or rest. You move by jet propulsion, hovering above the ground, unaffected by difficult terrain or obstacles. Your carry weight is 150 lbs., and it cannot be increased by your Strength or perks, but it can be increased by modified armor. You cannot recover from your own injuries or heal health points without receiving repairs (see Healing Robots, p.34).</p><p>You cannot manipulate the physical world like humans do, instead you have three of the arm attachments in the Arm Attachments table, determined by your choice of equipment pack. If you select an arm that features a weapon, you also gain 20 shots of ammo for that weapon.</p><p>You can choose not to have a pincer attachment as a Mister Handy, but in doing so, you will be unable to make unarmed attacks, manipulate objects, and you cannot make attempt tests that use the Lockpick, Repair, or Throwing skills.</p>;3;["Improved Sensors", "Immune to Radiation", "Immune to Poison", "Robo Body", "Hovering", "Robo Carry", "Robo Recovery", "Robo Pistol", "Robo Saw", "Robo Flamer", "Robo Laser", "Robo Pincer"]
Super Mutant;<p>You stand over seven feet tall, and your body is bulky and muscular. Your skin is green, yellow, or grey, regardless of what color it was when you were human. You do not seem to age, but you are sterile. You can only wear armor which has been made to fit a super mutant.</p><p>Your initial Strength and Endurance attributes are increased by +2 each, and your maximum Strength and Endurance are increased to 12, but your maximum Intelligence and Charisma are both reduced to 6. You may not have more than 4 ranks in any skill. You are completely immune to radiation and poison damage.</p>;0;["Immune to Radiation", "Immune to Poison", "Super Mutant Ranks", "Super Mutant Armor", "Strength Max", "Endurance Max", "Charisma Max", "Intelligence Max"]
